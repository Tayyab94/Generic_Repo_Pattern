# .NET Core Generic Repositories Project

Welcome to the .NET Core Generic Repositories Project! This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of generic repositories in a .NET Core application using .NET 8.

## Introduction

This project serves as a template or reference for implementing generic repositories in .NET Core applications. It provides a flexible and reusable way to interact with different data sources by abstracting the data access logic into generic repository classes.

## Features

- Implementation of generic repositories for data access.
- Utilizes .NET Core 8 features for efficient development.
- Provides a foundation for building scalable and maintainable .NET Core applications.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- .NET Core 8 SDK: [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Tayyab94/Generic_Repo_Pattern.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd your-repository
```

3. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.

4. Build the project using the following command:

```
dotnet build
```

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can use the generic repositories in your application:

1. Import the necessary namespaces in your code:

```csharp
using YourProject.Repositories;
```

2. Create instances of the generic repositories:

```csharp
var userRepository = new GenericRepository<User>(dbContext);
```

3. Use the repository methods to interact with your data:

```csharp
var users = userRepository.GetAll();
```

4. Customize the repository methods as per your application requirements.
